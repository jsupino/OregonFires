# Dataset obtained from **oregon.gov** Open Data Portal. Dataset name is *ODF Fire Occurrence Data 2000-2022*.
# 
# https://data.oregon.gov/Natural-Resources/ODF-Fire-Occurrence-Data-2000-2022/fbwv-q84y
# 
# Dataset contains **23.5k items** and **38 attributes**.
# 
# 
# **Objectives:**
# 1. Fire information about each area of Oregon
# 2. Find the different types of fire causes
# 3. Categorize the fires by size
# 4. Find the top 20 largest fires in Oregon between the years 2000 and 2022
# 5. Find all Oregon fires that occurred in 2022
# 6. Oregon Fires by Fire Year, Category, and Size

# **Background**
# 
# Fires are a natural occurrence throughout Oregon. Oregon has a varied geography, many different forest types, wildlife, and plant species. Forests in Oregon cover approximatelyÂ 30.5 million acres, almost half the state (2). ODF stands for the Oregon Department of Forestry. To improve the sustainability of the environment, economy, and community, the ODF is responsible for protecting and managing the forests of Oregon (3).

Most of the fires under investigation are approximately similar in terms of acres burned with a minimum of approximately 0.00 acres.
# 
# **Statistics:**

# - The median for lightning fires is approximately 0.10 acres with a mininimum of 0.00 acres and maximum of 0.25 acres. Q1 and Q3 are approximately 0.01 and 0.10 acres, respectively.
# - The median for fires under investigation is approximately 0.075 acres with a mininimum of 0.01 acres and maximum of 0.10 acres. Q1 and Q3 are approximately 0.075 and 0.075 acres, respectively.

# **Figure 7.** A Jupyter dash application with two dropdown menus and a slider. The user selects a class size and category of cause (human, lightning or under investigation) and uses the slider to choose the specific fire year from 2000 to 2022. Based on the attributes selected, the corresponding fire names and their estimated total acres are plotted in a bar chart.

# **Conclusion**
# 
# In conclusion, fires in Oregon are a natural occurrence. Oregon consists of a varied geography with many different forest types, wildlife, and plant species. Understanding the different types of fire causes and class sizes can help understand how these fires occur and how to prevent them.
# 
# The dataset contains information about 23,490 fires between the years 2000 and 2022. Ten items contained null values for latitude and longitude coordinates. By dropping these ten fires, the analysis will not be impacted because the dataset is so large. Along with this, there were 72 fires that did not contain the estimated total acres. This is an important factor in this analysis. Therefore, these fires were each grouped by their class size then filled in with the mean of the estimated total acres for each class size.
# 
# The dataset provides fires that occurred in the North, South, and East areas of Oregon. These areas consist mainly of forests, with many different forest types. As shown in Figure 1, the estimated total acres burned for each area of Oregon is shown. The most fires occurred in the South of Oregon with a total of 12,123 fires where Mixed Conifer and Douglas-fir forests are most popular. The least in the North of Oregon with a total of 3,695 fires. The East has the greatest estimated acres burned with approximately 3,246,420.68 acres, where Ponderosa Pine and Juniper Woodlands are most popular.

# Along with this, fires can be caused by many different factors. The main categories are human, lightning, and under investigation. Each category can be broken down into more general and specific causes. As shown in Figure 2, the number of fires caused be different types of causes are shown. Human fires can be caused by recreation, smoking, juveniles, etc. Approximately 17,189 fires were caused by humans. Lightning has sparked approximately 6,266 fires and can be difficult to prevent.

# Each fire can be classified as A, B, C, D, E, F, or G. The smallest fires are labeled as class size A and the largest fires are labeled as class size G. The greatest number of fires over the years in Oregon were class size A. As shown in Figure 3, class A fires are shown. Human, lightning, and under investigation fires classified as class size A had a median of 0.01, 0.10, and 0.075 acres burned, respectively. Both human and lightning fires had a max of 0.25 acres burned. The largest fires, labeled class size G, is shown in Figure 4. Class G fires had a median of 16,418, 23,163, and 58,753 acres burned for human, lightning, and under investigation, respectively. Lightning caused the largest fire that burned approximately 499,945 acres. This fire is called the Biscuit Private and ODF / BISCUIT. The fire was so large that both Coos and Southwest Oregon districts were impacted. Among the top fires in Oregon, a majority occurred in the year 2020 in the Cascades, which is North Oregon. Refer to Figure 5 for the top twenty largest fires that occurred throughout Oregon.

# Throughout the year 2022, there were a total of 886 fires in Oregon. As shown in Figure 6, a majority of these fires occurred in South Oregon. There were rarely any fires within the SouthEast region of Oregon. In the Jupyter Dash application, the user can find all the fires that occurred in a specific class size, year, and category of fire (human, lightning, or under investigation). The estimated total acres burned are shown for each fire.

# Oregon has a variety of geography, with approximately half of the state containing forests. These forests contain different types of trees, plants, and wildlife. Since fires are a natural occurrence throughout Oregon, it is important to understand where the most fires occur, why and how these fires occur. By understanding these fires, the state can take action to mitigate or even cease future fires.
